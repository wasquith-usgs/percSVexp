This source code repository is not designed for contributions but to a static component of Supplemental Information to accompany the research paper:

* Asquith, W.H., 2020, The use of support vectors from support vector machines for hydrometeorologic monitoring network analysis: Journal of Hydrology
(in press, January 14, 2020)
[William H. Asquith, 0000-0002-7400-1861; USGS Information Product Data System (IPDS) no. IP-104552 (internal agency tracking)]

The author's intent, should further work be made on the topic of the paper, that a fresh repository would be started over from scratch.
