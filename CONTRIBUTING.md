# CONTRIBUTING (./percSVMexp/CONTRIBUTING.md)

This source code repository is not designed for contributions but to a static component of Supplemental Materials to accompany the research paper:

* Asquith, W.H., 2019, Assessing Site Importance using Support Vectors for Hydrometeorologic Network Analyses: in reconciliation review with Journal of Hydrology. [William H. Asquith, 0000-0002-7400-1861; USGS Information Product Data System (IPDS) no. IP-104552 (internal agency tracking)]

The author's intent, should further work be made on the topic of the paper, that a fresh repository would be started over from scratch.
