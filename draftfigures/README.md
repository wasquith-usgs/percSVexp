# DETAILS

This directory is purposed to hold draft figures for portable document format (PDF) form from algorithms documented in this source code archive. Specifically, these figures are created by the `.R` scripts in the `../examapp` and `../gwanalog/` directories. For the purposes of authoring a draft academic paper (Asquith, 2019), these draft figures in `./draftfigures/` were copied over to another directory where the **LaTeX** sources for the paper that subsequently imports them.

Figures `fig09_svmtexaspp.pdf` and `fig10_svmtexasmap.pdf` are created by the script `../examapp/examapp.R`.
